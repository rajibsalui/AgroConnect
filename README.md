AgroConnect: Doesn’t just grow crops — it grows farmers, communities, and futures.

Description:

AgroConnect is a unified digital platform designed to empower Indian farmers by enabling them to directly connect with buyers, access personalized crop and pesticide advisories, and explore educational resources to modernize their agricultural practices. We believe that the true potential of agriculture in India remains untapped—not because of lack of produce, but due to broken supply chains, lack of awareness, and exploitation by intermediaries.# 🌾 AgroConnect
